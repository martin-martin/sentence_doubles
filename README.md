# (there are no) sentence twins

## A hommage to language creativity

Check out the .ipynb that's called `Copy1`. Just a tiny joke ðŸ˜‰

Something about a critique brought to Chomsky (maybe from Dixon?) made me do this project. The critique implied that there was a frequency associated to a sentence being spoken.
Chomsky argued that such a frequency doesn't exist, because it would generally be very close to 0.

And that's because we create language on the go.

## Language Creativity!

So I checked some corpora about whether there are any sentences in there that appear more than once.

There aren't really.

Cool.
