## A hommage to language creativity

The final code is in the .ipynb that's called `Copy1`. Just a tiny joke ðŸ˜‰

Currently you'll need to use jupyter notebooks in a Python 3.x environment to make it run.

Something about a critique of Chomsky's generative grammar made me do this project. The critique by Dixon implied that there should be a frequency associated to how often a sentence appears.
Chomsky argued that such a frequency doesn't exist, because it would in most cases be very close to 0.

And that's because we create language on the go.

## Language Creativity!

So I checked some corpora about whether there are any sentences in there that appear more than once.

There aren't really.

Cool.

## Update pending

I'm planning to refactor this project into a more thorough search and run it on a spoken-word corpus, to determine the cut-off value regarding the length of sentences. Because it is obvious that shorter sentences are certainly spoken using exactly the same words more often (e.g., just think about _Honey, I'm home!_ in various TV shows).

However, once the word count of a sentence increases, the doubles reduce drastically. I'm interested to find that cut-off value.
